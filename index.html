        <h2>Vedang Kevlani</h2>
        <p>I am a third year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree
            in Computer Science and a minor in Economics. I picked this field because of the excitement from being introduced to robotics in high school. The ability to add life to tiny parts of metal, and have these robots perform tasks was very eye-opening. I can fluently speak in three languages (English, Hindi and Sindhi) and hold decent conversational Spanish.
            I like to discover new music, do research on international affairs and play tennis.

            
            <br><br><strong>Why INFO2180: Dynamic Web Development 1?</strong><br><br>
<img src="./images/statdynamic.png" alt="Dynamic Web Development Picture"><br><br>            
            I have always had an interest in Economics and how policies are made or 
            how businesses can forecast growth/losses. I would like to specialize in Data Science
            after graduation so <i>"Dynamic Web Development 1"</i> can assist in creating cool UI experiences and
            dashboards. The benefits of learning HTML, CSS and JS in this course are universal and has no limits to creativity. I have heard from past students in this course that it is a very good elective with clear guidelines, helpful lecturers and tutors and positive vibes so I have great expectations and objectives that I hope are fulfilled after completing this course.
