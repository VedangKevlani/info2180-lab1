        <h2>Vedang Kevlani</h2>
        <p>I am a third year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree
            in Computer Science and a minor in Economics.
            
            <strong>Why Computer Science?</strong>
            I picked this field because of the excitement from being introduced to robotics in high
            school. The ability to add life to tiny parts of metal, and have these robots perform
            tasks was very eye-opening.
            
            I have always had an interest in Economics and how policies are made or 
            how businesses can forecast growth/losses. I would like to specialize in Data Science
            after graduation so <i>"Dynamic Web Development 1"</i> can assist in creating cool UI experiences and
            dashboards. I can fluently speak in three languages (English, Hindi and Sindhi) and hold decent conversational Spanish.
            I like to discover new music, do research on international affairs and play tennis.
